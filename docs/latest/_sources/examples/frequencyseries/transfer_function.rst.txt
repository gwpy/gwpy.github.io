Plotting a transfer function
############################

I would like to study how a signal transfers from one part of the
interferometer to another.

Specifically, it is interesting to measure the amplitude transfer of
ground motion through the HEPI system.



.. plot::
   :context: reset
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       from matplotlib import pyplot
       pyplot.ion()

Before anything else, we import the objects we will need:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   from gwpy.time import tconvert
   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeriesDict
   from gwpy.plot import BodePlot

and set the times of our query, and the channels we want:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   start = tconvert('May 27 2014 04:00')
   end = start + 1800
   gndchannel = 'L1:ISI-GND_STS_ITMY_Z_DQ'
   hpichannel = 'L1:HPI-ITMY_BLND_L4C_Z_IN1_DQ'

We can call the :meth:`~TimeSeriesDict.get` method of the `TimeSeriesDict`
to retrieve all data in a single operation:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   data = TimeSeriesDict.get([gndchannel, hpichannel], start, end, verbose=True)
   gnd = data[gndchannel]
   hpi = data[hpichannel]

Next, we can call the :meth:`~TimeSeries.average_fft` method to calculate
an averages, complex-valued FFT for each `TimeSeries`:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   gndfft = gnd.average_fft(100, 50, window='hamming')
   hpifft = hpi.average_fft(100, 50, window='hamming')

Finally, we can divide one by the other to get the transfer function
(up to the lower Nyquist)

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   size = min(gndfft.size, hpifft.size)
   tf = hpifft[:size] / gndfft[:size]

The `~gwpy.plot.BodePlot` knows how to separate a complex-valued
`~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries` into magnitude and phase:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :include-source:

   plot = BodePlot(tf)
   plot.maxes.set_title(
       r'L1 ITMY ground $\rightarrow$ HPI transfer function')
   plot.maxes.set_ylim(-55, 50)
   plot.show()
