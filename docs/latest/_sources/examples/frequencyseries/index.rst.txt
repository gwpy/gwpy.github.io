    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="One of the principal means of estimating the sensitivity of a gravitational-wave detector is to esimate it&#x27;s amplitude spectral density (ASD). The ASD is a measurement of how a signal&#x27;s amplitude varies across different frequencies.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="The most common visualisation of the spectral content of a data series is via the power or amplitude spectral density calculations (PSD or ASD). However, these typically involve averaging of the data over a period, which can wash out transient noise (as is often desired).">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="It can often be useful to add some known signal to inherently random or noisy data. For example, one might want to investigate what would happen if a binary black hole merger signal occured at or near the time of a glitch. In LIGO data analysis, this procedure is referred to as an injection.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="In LIGO the &#x27;Rayleigh&#x27; statistic is a calculation of the coefficient of variation of the power spectral density (PSD) of a given set of data. It is used to measure the &#x27;Gaussianity&#x27; of those data, where a value of 1 indicates Gaussian behaviour, less than 1 indicates coherent variations, and greater than 1 indicates incoherent variation. It is a useful measure of the quality of the strain data being generated and recorded at a LIGO site.">
