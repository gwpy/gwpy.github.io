Calculating the coherence between two channels
##############################################

The `coherence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)>`_ between
two channels is a measure of the frequency-domain correlation between their
time-series data.

In LIGO, the coherence is a crucial indicator of how noise sources couple into
the main differential arm-length readout.
Here we use use the :meth:`TimeSeries.coherence` method to highlight coupling
of motion of a beam periscope attached to the main laser table into the
strain output of the LIGO-Hanford interferometer.

These data are available as part of the |GWOSC_AUX_RELEASE|_.

First, we import the `TimeSeriesDict`

.. plot::
   :context: reset
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeriesDict

and then :meth:`~TimeSeriesDict.get` the data for the differential-arm
length servo control loop error signal (``H1:LSC-DARM_IN1_DQ``) and the
PSL periscope accelerometer (``H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ``):

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   data = TimeSeriesDict.get(
       ["H1:LSC-DARM_IN1_DQ", "H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ"],
       1186741560,
       1186742160,
       host="nds.gwosc.org",
   )
   darm = data["H1:LSC-DARM_IN1_DQ"]
   acc = data["H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ"]

We can then calculate the :meth:`~TimeSeries.coherence` of one
`TimeSeries` with respect to the other, using an 2-second Fourier
transform length, with a 1-second (50%) overlap:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   coh = darm.coherence(acc, fftlength=2, overlap=1)

Finally, we can :meth:`~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries.plot` the
resulting data:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :include-source:

   plot = coh.plot(
       xlabel="Frequency [Hz]", xscale="log",
       ylabel="Coherence", yscale="linear", ylim=(0, 1),
   )
   plot.show()

We can clearly see the correlation between the periscope motion and the
differential-arm length servo control loop error signal between 100 Hz
and 1000 Hz. Such physical couplings can interfere, mask, or even mimic
a gravitational wave signal inferred from the differential arm
length motion.
