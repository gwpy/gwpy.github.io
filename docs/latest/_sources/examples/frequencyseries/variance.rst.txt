Calculating and plotting a `SpectralVariance` histogram
#######################################################

The most common visualisation of the spectral content of a data series is
via the power or amplitude spectral density calculations (PSD or ASD).
However, these typically involve averaging of the data over a period, which
can wash out transient noise (as is often desired).

The `SpectralVariance` histogram provide by `gwpy.frequencyseries` allows
us to look at the spectral sensitivity in a different manner, displaying
which frequencies sit at which amplitude _most_ of the time, but also
highlighting excursions from normal behaviour.



To demonstate this, we can load some data from the LIGO Livingston
intereferometer around the time of the GW151226 gravitational wave detection:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   llo = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 1135136228, 1135140324, verbose=True)


We can then call the :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.spectral_variance`
method of the ``llo`` `~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` by calculating an ASD
every 5 seconds and counting the amount of time each frequency bin spends
at each ASD value:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   variance = llo.spectral_variance(5, fftlength=2, overlap=1, log=True,
                                    low=1e-24, high=1e-19, nbins=100)


We can then :meth:`~SpectralVariance.plot` the `SpectralVariance`


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   plot = variance.plot(norm='log', vmin=.5, cmap='plasma')
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.grid()
   ax.set_xlim(20, 1500)
   ax.set_ylim(1e-24, 1e-20)
   ax.set_xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')
   ax.set_ylabel(r'[strain/\rtHz]')
   ax.set_title('LIGO-Livingston sensitivity variance')
   plot.show()


From this we see that in general the sensitivity varies a few parts in 
10 :sup:`-23`, while many of the lines (narrow-band peaks in the spectrum)
are much more stationary.
