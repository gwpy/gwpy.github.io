Filtering a `TimeSeries` to detect gravitational waves
######################################################

The raw 'strain' output of the LIGO detectors is recorded as a `TimeSeries`
with contributions from a large number of known and unknown noise sources,
as well as possible gravitational wave signals.

In order to uncover a real signal we need to filter out noises that otherwise
hide the signal in the data. We can do this by using the :mod:`gwpy.signal`
module to design a digital filter to cut out low and high frequency noise, as
well as notch out fixed frequencies polluted by known artefacts.


First we download the raw strain data from the LOSC public archive:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('H1', 1126259446, 1126259478)

Next we can design a zero-pole-gain filter to remove the extranious noise.

First we import the `gwpy.signal.filter_design` module and create a
:meth:`~gwpy.signal.filter_design.bandpass` filter to remove both low and
high frequency content


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   from gwpy.signal import filter_design
   bp = filter_design.bandpass(50, 250, data.sample_rate)

Now we want to combine the bandpass with a series of
:meth:`~gwpy.signal.filter_design.notch` filters, so we create those
for the first three harmonics of the 60 Hz AC mains power:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   notches = [filter_design.notch(line, data.sample_rate) for
              line in (60, 120, 180)]

and concatenate each of our filters together to create a single ZPK:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   zpk = filter_design.concatenate_zpks(bp, *notches)

Now, we can apply our combined filter to the data, using `filtfilt=True`
to filter both backwards and forwards to preserve the correct phase
at all frequencies


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   b = data.filter(zpk, filtfilt=True)

.. note::

   The :mod:`~gwpy.signal.filter_design` methods return digital filters
   by default, so we apply them using `TimeSeries.filter`. If we had
   analogue filters (perhaps by passing `analog=True` to the filter design
   method), the easiest application would be `TimeSeries.zpk`

Finally, we can :meth:`~TimeSeries.plot` the original and filtered data,
adding some code to prettify the figure:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   from gwpy.plotter import TimeSeriesPlot
   plot = TimeSeriesPlot(
       data.crop(*data.span.contract(1)),
       b.crop(*b.span.contract(1)),
       figsize=[12, 8], sep=True, sharex=True)
   plot.axes[0].set_title('LIGO-Hanford strain data around GW150914')
   plot.axes[0].text(
       1.0, 1.0, 'Unfiltered data',
       transform=plot.axes[0].transAxes, ha='right')
   plot.axes[0].set_ylabel('Amplitude [strain]', y=-0.2)
   plot.axes[1].text(
       1.0, 1.0, '50-250\,Hz bandpass, notches at 60, 120, 180 Hz',
       transform=plot.axes[1].transAxes, ha='right')
   plot.show()

We see now a spike around 16 seconds into the data, so let's zoom into
that time by using :meth:`~TimeSeries.crop` and :meth:`~TimeSeries.plot`:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   plot = b.crop(1126259462, 1126259462.6).plot(figsize=[12, 4])
   plot.set_title('LIGO-Hanford strain data around GW150914')
   plot.set_ylabel('Amplitude [strain]')
   plot.set_epoch(1126259462.427)
   plot.show()

Congratulations, you have succesfully filtered LIGO data to uncover the
first ever directly-detected gravitational wave signal, GW150914!
The above filtering is (almost) the same as what was applied to LIGO data
to produce Figure 1 in
`Abbott et al. (2016) <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102>`_
(the joint LSC-Virgo publication announcing this detection).
