Plotting a `Spectrogram`
########################

One of the most useful methods of visualising gravitational-wave data is to
use a spectrogram, highlighting the frequency-domain content of some data
over a number of time steps.

For this example we can use the public data around the GW150914 detection.

First, we import the `TimeSeries` and call
:meth:`TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` the download the strain
data for the LIGO-Hanford interferometer

.. plot::
   :context: reset
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data(
       "H1", "Sep 14 2015 09:45", "Sep 14 2015 09:55")

Next, we can calculate a `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram` using the
:meth:`spectrogram` method of the `TimeSeries` over a 2-second stride
with a 1-second FFT and # .5-second overlap (50%):

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   specgram = data.spectrogram(2, fftlength=1, overlap=.5) ** (1/2.)

.. note::
   :meth:`TimeSeries.spectrogram` returns a Power Spectral Density (PSD)
   `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram` by default, so we use the ``** (1/2.)``
   to convert this into a (more familiar) Amplitude Spectral Density.

Finally, we can make a plot using the
:meth:`~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram.plot` method

.. plot::
   :context:
   :include-source:

   plot = specgram.imshow(norm="log", vmin=5e-24, vmax=1e-19)
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.set_yscale("log")
   ax.set_ylim(10, 2000)
   ax.colorbar(
       label=r"Gravitational-wave amplitude [strain/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$]")
   plot.show()

This shows the relative stability of the interferometer sensitivity over
the ten-minute span. Despite there being a gravitational-wave signal in the
data, the resolution (and dynamic range) of the spectrogram make it
impossible to see. The :ref:`next example <gwpy-example-spectrogram-ratio>`
shows you how to normalise a `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram` to better
see features in the most sensitive frequency band.
