In this example we demonstrate how to identify times of a published GW detection event, and to download and visualise detector data.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="One of the most useful tools for filtering and visualising short-duration features in a TimeSeries is the Q-transform. This is regularly used by the Detector Characterization working groups of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration to produce high-resolution time-frequency maps of transient noise (glitches) and potential gravitational-wave signals.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="It can often be useful to add some known signal to an inherently random or noisy timeseries. For example, one might want to examine what would happen if a binary black hole merger signal occured at or near the time of a glitch. In LIGO data analysis, this procedure is referred to as an injection.">

We can use this to check on the quality of the data from the LIGO Livingston detector around |GW170817|_.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Most data recorded from a gravitational-wave interferometer carry information across a wide band of frequencies, typically up to a few kiloHertz, but often it is the case that the low-frequency amplitude dwarfs that of the high-frequency content, making discerning high-frequency features difficult. This is especially true of the LIGO differential arm strain measurement, which encodes any gravitational wave signals that are present.">
