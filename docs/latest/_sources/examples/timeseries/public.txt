Plotting public LIGO data
#########################

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain time-series around the time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6).

These data are public, so we can load them directly from the web.



The `TimeSeries` object has a `classmethod` dedicated to fetching open-access
data hosted by the LIGO Open Science Center, so we can just import that
object

.. code-block:: python

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries


then call the `~TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` method, passing it the prefix
for the interferometer we want ('L1'), and the GPS start and stop times of
our query:

.. code-block:: python

   data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 968654552, 968654562)


and then we can make a plot:

.. code-block:: python

   plot = data.plot()
   plot.set_title('LIGO Livingston Observatory data for GW100916')
   plot.set_ylabel('Gravitational-wave strain amplitude')
   plot.show()

.. plot:: ../examples/timeseries/public.py
