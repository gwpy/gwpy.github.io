Comparing seismic trends between LIGO sites
###########################################

On Jan 16 2020 there was a series of earthquakes, that
should have had an impact on LIGO operations, I'd like to find out.

First: we import the objects we need, one for getting the data:

.. plot::
   :context: reset
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeriesDict

and one for plotting the data:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   from gwpy.plot import Plot

Next we define the channels we want, namely the 0.03Hz-1Hz ground motion
band-limited RMS channels (1-second average trends).
We do this using string-replacement so we can substitute the interferometer
prefix easily when we need to:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   channels = [
       '{ifo}:ISI-GND_STS_ITMY_Z_BLRMS_30M_100M',
   ]

At last we can :meth:`~TimeSeriesDict.get` 6 hours of data for each
interferometer:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:

   lho = TimeSeriesDict.get([c.format(ifo='H1') for c in channels],
                            'Jan 16 2020 8:00', 'Jan 16 2020 14:00',
                            host='losc-nds.ligo.org')
   llo = TimeSeriesDict.get([c.format(ifo='L1') for c in channels],
                            'Jan 16 2020 8:00', 'Jan 16 2020 14:00',
                            host='losc-nds.ligo.org')

Next we can plot the data, with a separate `~gwpy.plot.Axes` for each
instrument:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :include-source:

   plot = Plot(lho, llo, figsize=(12, 6), sharex=True, yscale='log')
   ax1, ax2 = plot.axes
   for ifo, ax in zip(('Hanford', 'Livingston'), (ax1, ax2)):
       ax.legend(['ground motion in the Z-direction'])
       ax.text(1.01, 0.5, ifo, ha='left', va='center', transform=ax.transAxes,
               fontsize=18)
   ax1.set_ylabel(r'$1-3$\,Hz motion [nm/s]', y=-0.1)
   ax2.set_ylabel('')
   ax1.set_title('Impact of earthquakes on LIGO')
   plot.show()

As we can see, the earthquake had a huge impact on the LIGO observatories,
severly imparing operations for several hours.
