Plotting segments for a `StateVector`
#####################################

Confident detection of gravitational-wave signals is critically dependent
on understanding the quality of the data searched.
Alongside the strain *h(t)* data, |GWOSC|_ also
releases a *Data Quality* :ref:`state vector <gwpy-statevector>`.
We can use this to check on the quality of the data from the LIGO Livingston
detector around |GW170817|_.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-36

First, we can import the `StateVector` class:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-38

.. code-block:: Python

    from gwpy.timeseries import StateVector








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-40

and download the state information surrounding GW170817:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-47

.. code-block:: Python

    data = StateVector.fetch_open_data(
        "L1",
        1187008882 - 100,
        1187008882 + 100,
        verbose=True,
    )





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Fetched 1 URLs from gwosc.org for [1187008782 .. 1187008982))
    Reading data... [Done]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-50

Finally, we make a :meth:`~StateVector.plot`, passing `insetlabels=True` to
display the bit names inside the axes:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-57

.. code-block:: Python

    plot = data.plot(insetlabels=True)
    ax = plot.gca()
    ax.set_xscale("seconds", epoch=1187008882)
    ax.axvline(1187008882, color="orange", linestyle="--")
    ax.set_title("LIGO-Livingston data quality around GW170817")
    plot.show()

This plot shows that for a short time exactly overlapping with GW170817
there was a data quality issue recorded that would negatively impact a
search for generic gravitational-wave transients (bursts).
For more details on this *glitch*, and on how it was excised, please see
the science summary for |GW170817|_.
