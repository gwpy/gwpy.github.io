Generating an inspiral range timeseries
#######################################

One standard figure-of-merit for the sensitivity of a gravitational-wave
detector is the distance to which a binary neutron star (BNS) inspiral
with two 1.4 solar mass components would be detected with a signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of 8. We can estimate this using
:func:`gwpy.astro.range_timeseries` directly from the strain readout for
a detector.

Data access
-----------
First, we need to load some data. We can `fetch` the
`public data <https://gwosc.org/catalog/>`__
around the GW170817 BNS merger:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-44

.. code-block:: Python


    from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
    h1 = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data("H1", 1187006834, 1187010930)
    l1 = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data("L1", 1187006834, 1187010930)

Range estimation
----------------
Then, we can measure the inspiral range directly, at 30 second granularity
with a 4-second FFT length starting at 10 Hz:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-54

.. code-block:: Python


    from gwpy.astro import range_timeseries
    h1range = range_timeseries(h1, 30, fftlength=4, fmin=10)
    l1range = range_timeseries(l1, 30, fftlength=4, fmin=10)

      return np.sqrt(4*np.trapz((h**2)/psd, self.freq))

Visualisation
-------------
We can now plot these trends to see the variation in LIGO
sensitivity over an hour or so surrounding GW170817:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-73

.. code-block:: Python


    plot = h1range.plot(
        label="LIGO-Hanford",
        color="gwpy:ligo-hanford",
        figsize=(12, 5),
    )
    ax = plot.gca()
    ax.plot(l1range, label="LIGO-Livingston", color="gwpy:ligo-livingston")
    ax.set_ylabel("Angle-averaged sensitive distance [Mpc]")
    ax.set_title("LIGO sensitivity to BNS around GW170817")
    ax.set_epoch(1187008882)  # <- set 0 on plot to GW170817
    ax.legend()
    plot.show()

Note, the extreme dip in LIGO-Livingston's sensitivity near GW170817
is caused by a loud, transient noise event, see `Phys. Rev. Lett.
vol. 119, p. 161101 <http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101>`_
