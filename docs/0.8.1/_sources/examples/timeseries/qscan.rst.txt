Generate the Q-transform of a `TimeSeries`
##########################################

One of the most useful tools for filtering and visualising short-duration
features in a `TimeSeries` is the
`Q-transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-Q_transform>`_.
This is regularly used by the Detector Characterization working groups of
the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration to produce
high-resolution time-frequency maps of transient noise (glitches) and
potential gravitational-wave signals.

This algorithm was used to visualise the first ever gravitational-wave
detection GW150914, so we can reproduce `that result (bottom panel of figure 1)
<https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102>`_ here.


First, we need to download the `TimeSeries` record for the H1 strain
measurement from `LOSC <//losc.ligo.org>`_:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('H1', 1126259446, 1126259478)

Next, we generate the `~TimeSeries.q_transform` of these data:

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   qspecgram = data.q_transform()

Now, we can plot the resulting `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram`, focusing on a
specific window around the interesting time

.. note::

   Using `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram.crop` is highly recommended at
   this stage because rendering the high-resolution spectrogram as it is
   done here is very slow (for experts this is because we're using
   `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh` and not any sort of image
   interpolation, mainly to support both linear and log scaling nicely)


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   gps = 1126259462.427
   plot = qspecgram.crop(gps-.15, gps+.05).plot(figsize=[8, 4])
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.set_epoch(gps)
   ax.set_yscale('log')
   ax.set_xlabel('Time [milliseconds]')
   ax.set_ylim(20, 500)
   ax.grid(True, axis='y', which='both')
   plot.add_colorbar(cmap='viridis', label='Normalized energy')
   plot.show()

Here we can clearly see the trace of a compact binary coalescence,
specifically a binary black hole coalescence!
