Plotting an over-dense, short-duration `Spectrogram`
####################################################

The normal `~TimeSeries.spectrogram` method uses non-overlapping intervals
to calculate discrete PSDs for each stride. This is fine for long-duration
data, but give poor resolution when studying short-duration phenomena.

The `~TimeSeries.spectrogram2` method allows for highly-overlapping FFT
calculations to over-sample the frequency content of the input `TimeSeries`
to produce a much more feature-rich output.


To demonstrate this, we can download some data associated with the
gravitational-wave event GW510914:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   lho = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('H1', 1126259458, 1126259467, verbose=True)

and can :meth:`~TimeSeries.highpass` and :meth:`~TimeSeries.whiten`
the remove low-frequency noise and try and enhance low-amplitude signals
across the middle of the frequency band:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   hp = lho.highpass(20)
   white = hp.whiten(4, 2).crop(1126259460, 1126259465)

.. note::

   We chose to :meth:`~TimeSeries.crop` out the leading and trailing 2
   seconds of the the whitened data series here to remove any filtering
   artefacts that may have been introduced.

Now we can call the `~TimeSeries.spectrogram2` method of `gwdata` to
calculate our over-dense `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram`, using a
1/16-second FFT length and high overlap:


.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   specgram = white.spectrogram2(fftlength=1/16., overlap=15/256.)

Finally, we make a plot:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   plot = specgram.plot(norm='log', cmap='viridis')
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.set_ylim(0, 500)
   ax.set_title('LIGO-Hanford strain data around GW150914')
   ax.set_epoch(1126259462.427)
   ax.set_xlim(1126259462.427-.5, 1126259462.427+.5)
   plot.show()

Here we can see the trace of a high-mass binary black hole system,
referred to as GW150914.
