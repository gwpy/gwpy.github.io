Plotting public LIGO data
#########################

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain time-series around the
time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6).

These data are public, so we can load them directly from the web.


The `TimeSeries` object has a `classmethod` dedicated to fetching open-access
data hosted by the LIGO Open Science Center, so we can just import that
object

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

then call the `~TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` method, passing it the prefix
for the interferometer we want ('L1'), and the GPS start and stop times of
our query:

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 968654552, 968654562)

and then we can make a plot:

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   plot = data.plot(
       title='LIGO Livingston Observatory data for HW100916',
       ylabel='Gravitational-wave strain amplitude',
   )
   plot.show()
