Whitening a `TimeSeries`
########################

.. warning::

   This example requires LIGO.ORG credentials for data access.

Most data recorded from a gravitational-wave interferometer carry information
across a wide band of frequencies, typically up to a few kiloHertz, but
often it is the case that the low-frequency amplitude dwarfs that of the
high-frequency content, making discerning high-frequency features difficult.

We employ a technique called 'whitening' to normalize the power at all
frequencies so that excess power at any frequency is more obvious.

We demonstrate below with an auxiliary signal recording transmitted power
in one of the interferometer arms, which recorded two large glitches with
a frequency of around 5-50Hz.


First, we import the `TimeSeries` and :meth:`~TimeSeries.get` the data:

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   data = TimeSeries.get('H1:ASC-Y_TR_A_NSUM_OUT_DQ', 1123084671, 1123084703)

Now, we can `~TimeSeries.whiten` the data to enhance the higher-frequency
content

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   white = data.whiten(4, 2)

and can `~TimeSeries.plot` both the original and whitened data

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   from gwpy.plot import Plot
   plot = Plot(data, white, separate=True, sharex=True)
   plot.axes[0].set_ylabel('Y-arm power [counts]', fontsize=16)
   plot.axes[1].set_ylabel('Whitened amplitude', fontsize=16)
   plot.show()

Here we see two large spikes that are completely undetected in the raw
`TimeSeries`, but are very obvious in the whitened data.
