Plotting segments for a `StateVector`
#####################################

Confident detection of gravitational-wave signals is critically dependent
on understaind the quality of the data search.
Alongside the strain _h(t)_ data, |LOSC|_ also releases a _Data Quality_
:ref`state vector <gwpy-statevector`>.
We can use this to check on the quality of the data from the LIGO Livingston
detector around `GW170817 <https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW170817/>`__.


First, we can import the `StateVector` class:

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import StateVector

and download the state information surrounding GW170817:

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context:

   data = StateVector.fetch_open_data('L1', 1187008882-100, 1187008882+100,
                                      verbose=True, tag='C00')

Finally, we make a :meth:`~StateVector.plot`, passing `insetlabels=True` to
display the bit names inside the axes:

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   plot = data.plot(insetlabels=True)
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.set_xscale('seconds', epoch=1187008882)
   ax.axvline(1187008882, color='orange', linestyle='--')
   ax.set_title('LIGO-Livingston data quality around GW170817')
   plot.show()

This plot shows that for a short time exactly overlapping with GW170817
there was a data quality issue recorded that would negatively impact a
search for generic gravitational-wave transients (bursts).
