Plotting an `EventTable` in a scatter
#####################################

I would like to study the event triggers generated by the `ExcessPower <link>`_
gravitational-wave burst detection algorithm, over a small stretch of data.

The data from which these events were generated are a simulation of Gaussian noise
with the Advanced LIGO design spectrum, and so don't actually contain any real
gravitational waves, but will help tune the algorithm to improve detection of
future, real signals.


First, we import the `EventTable` object and read in a set of events from
a LIGO_LW-format XML file containing a
:class:`sngl_burst <glue.ligolw.lsctables.SnglBurstTable>` table

.. plot::
   :nofigs:
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.table import EventTable
   events = EventTable.read(
       'H1-LDAS_STRAIN-968654552-10.xml.gz', format='ligolw.sngl_burst',
       columns=['time', 'central_freq', 'snr'])

.. note::

   Here we manually specify the `columns` to read in order to optimise
   the `read()` operation to parse only the data we actually need.

We can now make a scatter plot by specifying the x- and y-axis columns,
and (optionally) the colour:

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   plot = events.plot('time', 'central_freq', color='snr')
   ax = plot.gca()
   ax.set_yscale('log')
   ax.set_ylabel('Frequency [Hz]')
   ax.set_epoch(968654552)
   ax.set_xlim(968654552, 968654552+10)
   ax.set_title('LIGO-Hanford event triggers for HW100916')
   plot.add_colorbar(clim=[1, 10], cmap='YlGnBu',
                     label='Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)')
   plot.show()

This shows the central time and frequency of each event trigger (row
in the ``events`` table). Alternatively we can visualise each trigger
as a two-dimensional tile on the time-frequency plane - for more details
see the example :ref:`gwpy-example-table-tiles`.
